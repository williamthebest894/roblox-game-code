So this is the roblox game we made, I am including the main scripts here.
You can't play the game based on this, you need to play it in roblox studio or roblox.
To play,
1. Go to roblox.com and create an account(if you don't have one)
2. Search up 123cookie2018
3. Click on the person and go to view full profile
4. Go to creations and click on the multiple squares option
5. Click on Partner Parkour, and play the game!
